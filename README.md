# Decision Making Calculator

A Python GUI application that helps you make decisions by comparing different alternatives using various decision-making methods.

## üéØ What Does It Do?

This tool helps you when you:

- Have multiple choices (alternatives)
- Each choice has different possible outcomes
- Need help deciding which choice is best

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Python** (version 3.x)
2. **Run the program**:

```bash
python uncertaintyProject.py
```

## üìù How to Use

### Step 1: Add Your Alternatives

1. Enter a name (e.g., "Job A")
2. Enter possible outcomes separated by commas (e.g., "50000, 60000, 45000")
3. Click "Add Alternative"

Example:

```
Name: Job A
Values: 50000, 60000, 45000

Name: Job B
Values: 45000, 65000, 55000
```

### Step 2: Choose a Decision Method

Pick one of these buttons:

- **Maximax** (The Optimist's Choice)

  - Looks at the best possible outcome
  - Good if you're feeling lucky!

- **Maximin** (The Cautious Choice)

  - Looks at the worst possible outcome
  - Good if you want to play it safe

- **Hurwicz** (The Balanced Choice)

  - Combines optimistic and pessimistic views
  - You choose how optimistic you want to be (0-1)

- **Laplace** (The Average Choice)
  - Takes the average of all outcomes
  - Good when all outcomes are equally likely

### Step 3: View Results

The program will show you:

- The calculated result
- Which alternative is best according to your chosen method

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Use Case

Deciding between two job offers:

```
Job A: Base salary + possible bonus
Values: 50000, 60000, 45000
(Base salary, Good year, Bad year)

Job B: Commission-based salary
Values: 45000, 65000, 55000
(Minimum, Maximum, Average)
```
